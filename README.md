# Ex20_AccessRestfulWebService
Lecture 05 - Data Layer and HTTP Communications

The app displays a list of 10 persons randomly generated by the Random User Generator web service (https://randomuser.me/).
- More persons can be retrieved and added to the list by clicking on the FloatingActionButton.
- The user can select whether to access the web service using Retrofit (by default) or UrlConnection through the action elements in the ActionBar.
- The JSON response is automatically converted into a Kotlin object using the Moshi library. A Kotlin Result wraps this object, and it will contain a People object if the operation was successful (it will be displayed in a RecyclerView) or a type of Exception otherwise (a Snackbar will notify the problem). 
- The Glide library is used to retrieve the pictures of the persons from the web service an display them in the corresponding View.
- The Data Layer is structured in one Repository and two Data Sources. Both expose suspend function that are main-safe: the former to the ViewModel and the latter to the Repository.
- Hilt is used to manage dependency injection.
